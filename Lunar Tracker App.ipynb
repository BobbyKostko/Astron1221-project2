    "# Lunar Phase Calendar App\n",
    "__[Github Repository](https://github.com/BobbyKostko/Astron1221-project2)__\n",
    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "- The moon's size and brightness in the sky often interfere with astronomical observation\n",
    "- We wanted to create a tool designed for amateur astronomers who might not have the coding, data wrangling, or astronomy skills needed to accurately track the moon for good viewing conditions\n",
    "- This puts a heavy emphasis on user-friendly implementation and accessibility\n",
    "- We will generate data on lunar phase, rise/set times, and other important lunar events such as eclipses, packaging this data for easy use by others\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding Methods\n",
    "- Pull data on earth/moon locations and rise/set times from the DE 421 ephemeris which is loaded through skyfield \n",
    "- Calculate illumination percentages and lunar events with this data, arranging our calculations in our own PANDAS table\n",
    "- Store our data on GitHub and push it to a Streamlit app to generate lunar reports on nightly phase and other noteable lunar events\n",
    "- Streamlit implementation means nobody needs to meet the installation dependencies of our code or know how to run it. They dont even need to run it at all since the data is nestled in our repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installations and Requirements\n",
    "### As listed in our repository's requirements.txt file, to run the data generation code, you need to install:\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "- Skyfield\n",
    "- Numpy\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Additionally, our web app has separate requirements (also in requirements.txt):\n",
    "- Streamlit\n",
    "- Plotly (for data visualizations)\n",
    "- Pillow (for calendar generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Laying the Foundations\n",
    "We start with making all of our imports, loading the proper ephemeris, and establishing a few objects and planetary constants used throughout the data generation process."

    "- For an amateur astronomer looking either at the moon or trying to guage how much the moon affects sky visibility on a given night, 90% is good enough to be almost indistinguishable from 100%.\n",
