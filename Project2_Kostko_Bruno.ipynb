    "# Lunar Phase Calendar App\n",
    "__[Github Repository](https://github.com/BobbyKostko/Astron1221-project2)__\n",
    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "- The moon's size and brightness in the sky often interfere with astronomical observation\n",
    "- We wanted to create a tool designed for amateur astronomers who might not have the coding, data wrangling, or astronomy skills needed to accurately track the moon for good viewing conditions\n",
    "- This puts a heavy emphasis on user-friendly implementation and accessibility\n",
    "- We will generate data on lunar phase, rise/set times, and other important lunar events such as eclipses, packaging this data for easy use by others\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding Methods\n",
    "- Pull data on earth/moon locations and rise/set times from the DE 421 ephemeris which is loaded through skyfield \n",
    "- Calculate illumination percentages and lunar events with this data, arranging our calculations in our own PANDAS table\n",
    "- Store our data on GitHub and push it to a Streamlit app to generate lunar reports on nightly phase and other noteable lunar events\n",
    "- Streamlit implementation means nobody needs to meet the installation dependencies of our code or know how to run it. They dont even need to run it at all since the data is nestled in our repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installations and Requirements\n",
    "### As listed in our repository's requirements.txt file, to run the data generation code, you need to install:\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "- Skyfield\n",
    "- Numpy\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Additionally, our web app has separate requirements (also in requirements.txt):\n",
    "- Streamlit\n",
    "- Plotly (for data visualizations)\n",
    "- Pillow (for calendar generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Laying the Foundations\n",
    "We start with making all of our imports, loading the proper ephemeris, and establishing a few objects and planetary constants used throughout the data generation process."

    "## Important Caveats to our Data\n",
    "Naturally, our data has its limitations. We chose to go for a broad timespan for our data give our app a much broader use, but that means we had to sacrifice some precision in our data. Running our calculations for eclipses and lunar phases only a few times (or even once) per night means we almost never actually capture the true peak eclipse depth time, or are able to tell you the specific illumination percentage at any time of day. We could fix these imprecise calculations by only changing a few lines of code, but our final code appears this way for one main reason. __I don't want my laptop to explode!__\n",
    "\n",
    "For the amount of time it took to generate our current csv file, running these same checks several more times each night creates a serious issue of computing power. It wouldn't be impossible to leave a laptop running overnight to generate more accurate or time sensitive data, but with the time constraints of this project and the number of iterations the CSV file has gone through, This level of data quality is simply all we are willing to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "This level of data precision is also good enough for most of what we are trying to deliver. It contains very precise rise/set times, and while it may not have the exact start time and max depth of an eclipse, it will catch any major lunar eclipses and a time when they are happening without fail. For backyard stargazers who aren't trying to take precise measurements or make astronomical predictions, having this general info is often good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Additions\n",
    "- __Better eclipse data__ gotten by taking more samples throughout the night\n",
    "- __Charting the moon's location__ in the sky. Letting us create a visualization of the moon's path through the sky.\n",
    "- __Tracking obscured celestial bodies__ using the moon's position in the sky and its brightness to measure stargazing conditions. This would allow us to list important objects in the sky such as planets or bright stars that might be blocked by the moon or its light at a certain point in the night.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI Limitations\n",
    "Our project relied on using Cursor AI to help write code. However, there were certain points where this AI struggled.\n",
    "- __Using Skyfield__ was difficult at times.\n",
    "    - Cursor specifically struggled to understand Skyfield's almanac feature. It did not use the almanac on its own, and even struggled to do so when directly told to.\n",
    "    - It also didn't understand the output of certain functions like .separation_from() which will only return an angle between 0-180. The lunar phase angle ranges from 0-360 to account for the difference between waxing and waning. This is easily fixable by using Skyfield's almanac. Too bad it didn't know how to do that.\n",
    "- __Understanding basic astronomy concepts__ such as how the moon must be above the horizon at least once a day. This led to the creation of several useless variables and lines of code that had to be manually deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Our project successfully retrieves and manipulates ephemeris data to get information about the moon on a given day. We were able to package this data and deliver it  in a user-friendly way to anyone via web app. Most of this project's difficulty was found not in hard astronomical calculations but rather efficiently finding and storing data in PANDAS format to be manipulated and displayed in a more readable format than a BSP or CSV file."
